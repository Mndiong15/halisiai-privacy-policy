    <h1>Privacy Policy for Halisiai</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 12, 2024</p>

    <h2>Welcome to Halisiai</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Halisiai, the personal finance app designed to empower you with personalized financial insights. Your privacy is paramount to us, and this Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Halisiai provides personalized financial advice by analyzing your financial data. To offer these services, we require you to link your financial accounts through Plaid, a third-party service that enables secure financial data sharing.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> When you link your financial accounts, Plaid shares access tokens with us. While we do not store your banking login credentials, we securely store these access tokens on our servers. The financial data we access includes bank account balances, transaction history, and associated data names necessary to provide personalized advice.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, and other contact information to create and manage your account, communicate with you, and ensure a tailored user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information:</h3>
    <p>To Provide Services: We use your financial data to offer personalized financial insights. Our use of OpenAI's LLM involves processing your financial data to generate tailored advice. However, we ensure that no banking information is directly exposed to the LLM.</p>
    <p>For Security: We use your information to enhance the security of our app, prevent fraud, and protect our users.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Halisiai is committed to protecting your privacy. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. Data sharing is limited to the following circumstances:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>With Service Providers: We share information with trusted service providers, including Plaid and OpenAI, solely for the purpose of providing our services. These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements and are prohibited from using your information for any other purpose.</li>
        <li>For Legal Reasons: We may disclose information if required by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with legal processes, protect our rights or property, or ensure the safety of our users or the public.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement robust security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These include encryption, firewalls, and secure server hosting. Despite our efforts, no security measures are completely infallible; therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information stored with us. You can manage your information through the app settings or contact us directly for assistance.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes and post the updated policy on our website.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:business@halisiai.com"> business@halisiai.com</a>.</p>
